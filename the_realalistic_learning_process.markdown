Learning to "Code" in 21 days may just be too Gimmicky

I saw this really funny comic strip and I thought it would bring me to do a Reading Time video:

(Musically, Reading Time!)

Seriously though I think of learning to code like lifting weights.  It just takes time to build understanding and experience, like building muscle.  Imagine if we saw a cover, power lift 1000 lbs in 21 days!  The first thing I would say would be, "Why?"

But, as a newbie, I've come to learn that it takes a while to learn to code well. It's something that's just part of the process, and I think that that's ok.  Especially since, there doesn't seem to be a way around it.

So, This is my public service announcement... stop trying to learning things in 21 days, and take a second to enjoy to process a bit.

Here are something things you can do instead of learning to code in 21 days:

1)  write a blog about what you've learned
2)  find a coding buddy to code with
3)  think of some funny things you've experience since learning to code
4)  give me money
5)  work with a non profit or open source project
6)  make a website for a friend
7)  learn to use your text editor more efficiently
8)  hug someone you love
9)  join a newbie community and find a mentor
10) join a newbie community and fine a mentee

I've come to believe that learning to code can be a pain I'm just just trying to get through, or it can be a process I respect and embrace.  I've had a much better time just taking things as they are and working from that point, not 21 days.

What do you think?

Next week, I'll take about how to make the most of your learning sessions and shortening the learning curve.
