     <h1>Beginners Guide to Understanding Rails</h1>
     <p class="post-date">< 6 Jul 2015></p>
     <hr/>
     <p><em>Here we will look at concepts from Course 2 of Lesson 1 with TeaLeaf</em></p>

<p>I’ve created this tutorial to quickly create/edit files and see how this affected the application.  This is meant to walk through a simple Request from a User and a Response from the App.</p>

<p>Major Topics include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rails template intro</li>
  <li>Routes</li>
  <li>ActionController</li>
  <li>Views and the <code>render</code> method</li>
  <li>Models</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rails-template-intro-wow-lets-get-into-it">1. RAILS TEMPLATE INTRO: Wow, Let’s Get Into It.</h2>

<p>Starting from the very beginning, it’s a very good place to start.  I’m running on a Mac with Yosemite OS X, if you’re reading this to learn Rails, I HIGHLY recommend that you run the code to make the information more tactile.  Commands will be from the “Terminal” application, Rails version “4.1.6”</p>

<p>Assuming you have all the installations, when starting a Rails app, the first call is usually:</p>

<p><code>$ rails new APPNAME</code></p>

<p>and this would give you a default file set as follows if we executed:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ rails new coolness
$ cd coolness
</code></pre>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>|-- app

|       |-- images

<h6 id="figure-a-file-structure-of-new-rails-application">Figure A: File structure of new Rails Application</h6>

<p>READMORE</p>

<p>Oh boy, that’s a lot of stuff, but to help focus your attention, here is something that will help simplify the process.  We’ll go over an overview of a “request” and then examine specific files from the file structure.  Overall, we’ll mainly focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>config/routes.rb</code></li>
  <li><code>app/controllers</code></li>
  <li><code>app/views</code></li>
  <li><code>app/models</code></li>
  <li><code>db/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Other files will be looked at later… still haven’t really learned about ‘em yet.  :)</p>

<p><strong>PRACTICE</strong>: check the files and folders above, and see if you can locate them in the folder tree, Figure A.</p>

<p>(Starting Rails doesn’t require knowing every file… cool huh?)</p>

<h2 id="visual-pneumonic">VISUAL PNEUMONIC</h2>

<h6 id="figure-b-image-of-mvc-app-with-rails-ripped-off-from-tealeaf-course-material-">Figure B: Image of MVC app with Rails (ripped off from TeaLeaf Course material. :))</h6>

<p>This (Figure B) my friends is a picture that will help explain the mechanics of a <em>Model, View, Controller</em> (MVC) on a Rails application.</p>

<h3 id="general-overview-request-and-response">General Overview: Request and Response</h3>

<h4 id="request">Request</h4>

<p>We’ll start at the top left, the “User” makes a request to the server and we can look at <code>routes.rb</code> to see how it’s handled.</p>

<h4 id="response">Response</h4>

<p>From routes, the request triggers a “Controller Action” and from there the “Model” Layer may or may not get data from the “DataBase”.  Information is then assembled and finally a “View” is returned for the User.</p>

<p>I know there are a lot of files in a Rails template, but as we examine the mechanics of how the internet works (through this Request and Response) the Rails parts and conventions will be more clear.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="routes">2. ROUTES</h2>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// file path to consider:
// coolness/config/routes.rb
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="routes portion of Figure B" src="../../../../images/routes.png" /></p>

<h6 id="figure-c-looking-at-the-routes-portion-of-the-visual-pneumonic">Figure C: Looking at the routes portion of the Visual Pneumonic</h6>

<p>“Everyone” knows that a http browser request consists of a <code>Verb</code> a <code>URL addess</code> and possibly <code>parameters</code></p>

<p>The <code>routes.rb</code> file helps link the request with a specific “Controller” and “Action”</p>

<p>For example, the <code>routes.rb</code> file can look as follows:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'products/:id' =&gt; 'products#view'
end
</code></pre>

<h6 id="figure-d-basic-routesrb-file">Figure D: Basic <code>routes.rb</code> file.</h6>

<p>With the following file, a <code>GET</code> request to the path <code>products/4</code> would map to the <code>products</code> controller and the <code>view</code> action.  Also, parameters would be available with the <code>params[:id]</code> method in this <code>view</code> action.</p>

<p>I know what you’re thinking,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jason, if we want RESTful routes we’ll need more then <code>get 'products/:id' =&gt; 'product#view'</code>.  What about all the CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Destroy? What the ef man?!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a complete restful route of a “product” controller, the routes file would look something like this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Reminder… actually type up this information on you late model Mac Book Pro for optimal awesomeness!!!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get    '/products'          =&gt; 'products#index'
  post   '/products/'         =&gt; 'products#create'
  get    '/products/new'      =&gt; 'products#new'
  get    '/products/:id/edit' =&gt; 'products#edit'
  get    '/products/:id'      =&gt; 'products#show'
  patch  '/products/:id'      =&gt; 'products#update'
  put    '/products/:id'      =&gt; 'products#update'
  delete '/products/:id'      =&gt; 'products#destroy'
end
</code></pre>

<h6 id="figure-e-getting-all-crudy-with-routesrb">Figure E: Getting all CRUDy with <code>routes.rb</code></h6>

<p>Looking at <code>$ rake routes</code> from the terminal we’ll get more information on what we are working on and the conventions of Rails.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ rake routes
      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
    products GET    /products(.:format)          products#index
             POST   /products(.:format)          products#create
products_new GET    /products/new(.:format)      products#new
             GET    /products/:id/edit(.:format) products#edit
             GET    /products/:id(.:format)      products#show
             PATCH  /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             PUT    /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             DELETE /products/:id(.:format)      products#destroy
</code></pre>

<p>Starting from the left, we’ll see that Rails actually gives us helper methods <code>products</code> and <code>products_new</code> to do things like access the path to these URIs  (ie. <code>products_path</code>).  On the right, we have a collection of more complete actions to get the full CRUD functions for persistent storage.</p>

<p>Since this is a staple in Rails development, all this can be shortened:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :products
end
</code></pre>

<p>With that one line of code we get all that stuff we listed out from Figure E.  To prove my point, let’s look at <code>$ rake routes</code></p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ rake routes
       Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                 Controller#Action
product_index GET    /products(.:format)          products#index
              POST   /products(.:format)          products#create
  new_product GET    /products/new(.:format)      products#new
 edit_product GET    /products/:id/edit(.:format) products#edit
      product GET    /products/:id(.:format)      products#show
              PATCH  /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
              PUT    /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
              DELETE /products/:id(.:format)      products#destroy
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that we get basically the same Controller Actions and even more helper methods!</p>

<p>Whew!!! That was a mouthful.  Routes are a great way to peer into the inner workings of a Rails app and there’s a lot more to learn.  This is enough for us to move on through the next portion of the Visual Pneumonic… ActionController.  A Request has been made and now the Coolness App will Respond accordingly.</p>

<p>Other routes features are possible though like: nesting, and direct declaration between URI and action.</p>

<p><em>For more information on routes <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html">checkout the guides</a></em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="actioncontroller">3. ACTIONCONTROLLER</h2>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// file paths to consider
// coolness/app/controllers/
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="controller portion of Figure C" src="../../../../images/controller.png" /></p>

<h6 id="figure-f-actioncontroller-portion-of-the-visual-pneumonic">Figure F: ActionController portion of the Visual Pneumonic</h6>

<p>So, now that we have an routes correctly directed, how do we work with the <code>Controller#Action</code>s?</p>

<p>Again, the conventions need to be followed here and if we want to have a <code>Products</code> Controller, we’re going to need a have a <code>products_controller.rb</code> file in the <code>coolness/app/controllers/</code> folder of the application.  Generally, the convention is <code>#{Controller_Name_Plural}_controller.rb</code></p>

<p>For the “Actions”, we can look inside the controller folder and write the following file:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @product = "soap"
  end

  def show
  end

  def new
  end

  def create
  end

  def edit
  end

  def update
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Right now, our application doesn’t do anything except go from the router to the Controller so we’ll move on with a dummy product <code>@product = "soap"</code>.  By convention, the next step would involve displaying a view if the “Model” layer isn’t accessed.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="view-and-the-render-method">4. VIEW AND THE <code>render</code> METHOD</h2>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// file path to consider
// coolness/app/views/
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="views portion of Figure D" src="../../../../images/views.png" /></p>

<h6 id="figure-g-looking-at-the-views-portion-of-the-visual-pneumonic">Figure G: Looking at the views portion of the Visual Pneumonic</h6>

<p>Now, we’ve moved from the User to the “Router” and then the “Controller” so we can now see a “View” and essentially “Respond” to the User.</p>

<p>To work with a “View”, the Rails convention is:</p>

<p><code>app/view/${Controller_plural}/#{action}.html.erb</code></p>

<p>So, given that we have our dummy “soap” data, if we wanted to see it, we would create the following file in the <code>coolness/app/views/products/</code> folder.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/app/views/products/index.html.erb
&lt;h1&gt;You've a dirty guy so have some: &lt;%= @product %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This would give us an entire loop from the User to the Coolness Application and back to the User.  Since this completes one Request Response loop, lets fire up the server (<code>$ rails server</code>) and see what we got here.</p>

<p>Thinking about the rake routes, we want to access the <code>Index</code> action and view from the <code>Products</code> controller.  The <code>GET</code> verb is being implied here, the URI would then be:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost:3000/products</code></p>

<p>and the Response:</p>

<p><img alt="Browser view of Index View" src="../../../../images/index_display.png" /></p>

<h6 id="figure-h-response-from-coolness-app">Figure H: Response from ‘Coolness’ app</h6>

<h2 id="hoozzaaahh">Hoozzaaahh!!!</h2>

<h3 id="and-now-the-render-method">and now the <code>render</code> method</h3>

<p>In our view, lets say we wanted to utilize partials for a nav bar like follows:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;%= link_to "Products", products_path %&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;%= link_to "Blog", blog_path %&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Learn about the <code>link_to</code> method <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper/link_to">in the documents</a></p>

<p>We can save the code above in a partial had use <code>render</code> to copy it into our views if we wanted.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// we're saving the code here
// app/views/partials/_nav.html.erb
&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;%= link_to "Products", products_path %&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;%= link_to "Blog", blog_path %&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Looking back at our products#index view, we can call the <code>render</code> method like so.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// app/views/products/index.html.erb

&lt;%= render "partials/nav" %&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;You've a dirty guy so have some: &lt;%= @product %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And our view would have the <code>_nav.html.erb</code> partial info at the top!</p>

<p><img alt="output from partials" src="../../../../images/partial_output.png" /></p>

<h4 id="render-in-the-controller-actions"><code>render</code> in the Controller actions</h4>

<p><code>render</code> can also be used in the “Controller” actions to use another view.  In fact, to understand Rails convention, think of render directing the view to the coresponding action in a given Controller.  For example, our App right now our Products controller looks like:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @product = "soap"
  end
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>But, insted of leaning on convention, we could get more litteral and write…</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @product = "soap"
    render "products/index"
  end
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>If we wanted to render another view we could have also used other parameters.  Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>render file: “path/…”</li>
  <li>render “OTHERCLASS/ACTION”</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, this isn’t everything we learned this first week, but it’s most of what we need to know for this post.  For more info on Views and <code>render</code> you can <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html">consult the guides</a></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="models">5. Models</h2>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// file path to consider
// for models:   coolness/app/models/
// for Database: coolness/db/
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="model and DataBase" src="../../../../images/data.png" /></p>

<h6 id="figure-j-model-and-database-portion-of-the-visual-pneumonic">Figure J: Model and DataBase Portion of the Visual Pneumonic</h6>

<p>One thing that helped me make sense of this part was to think of the DataBase running as a separate application.  The Rails development template uses SQLite as the DataBase and ActiveRecord is the standard of interfacing with this persistance layer.  In production, another DataBase “application” could be used (like PostGres or another SQL) but ActiveRecord’s methods would not be different.</p>

<p>So, let’s continue by making a Model for the Products Class we’ve created.  Model files are conventionally the name of the class in singular form.  Create the following file:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/app/models/product.rb
class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end
</code></pre>

<p>The standard way to save objects created from the Products class will be in the DataBase.  Commonly this information can be thought of as a table with the columns as attributes of the class and rows as instances of the class.</p>

<p>In order to make sure that all developers working with the application have similar DataBases, migration files are used to instantiate these tables or alter the DataBase.</p>

<p>We can use the <code>generate migration</code> command in the terminal to create a Products table migration file.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Product class table would be lowercase and plural by default.  To find out the conventional table name of other classes, we can use the <code>.tableize</code> method from the <code>rails console</code>.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// from the commandline
$ rails console
&gt; "Goose".tableize
 =&gt; "gooses"
</code></pre>

<p>Lets’s look at what our migration file looks like, here we have the terminal.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ rails generate migration create_products
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20150414105652_create_products.rb
</code></pre>

<p>The migration file created has a timestamps to make sure that migrations that change the DataBase aren’t mixed up.  Let’s go to this file and set up a Product table instantiation.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// checking out migration...
// coolness/db/migrate/20150414105652_create_products.rb

class CreateProducts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s give the Products a name and <code>.timestamps</code>.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/db/migrate/20150414105652_create_products.rb

class CreateProducts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The convention is to take the enumerating variable <code>|t|</code> and declare attribues as follows:</p>

<p><code>t.#{type} :#{attribute_name}</code></p>

<p>If you haven’t figured it out but now, there are TONS of conventions and learning Rails is simply being exposed to all these shortcuts and understanding the logic behind it.  To illustrate, let’s look at that <code>t.timestamps</code> part next.</p>

<p><code>t.timestamps</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creates two columns on the Product table <code>created_at</code> and <code>updated_at</code></li>
  <li>is automatically updated when the object is created or updated and saved to the DataBase.</li>
  <li>is of type datetime</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>With the migration file set up, we can now create the table by going to the terminal and running <code>$ rake db:migrate</code></p>

<p><strong>MORE CONVENTIONS!!!</strong>  Again to further illustrate my point about conventions here’s a word about migrations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running <code>$ rake db:migrate</code> runs the migration files in order from earliest to latest.</li>
  <li>If a migration file was already executed previously, it will skip it and move on to the next file.</li>
  <li>When changing the DataBase (ie. removing a column or renaming a table etc.) it’s best not to change existing migration files since these changes could be missed by other developers working on the application.  In otherwords, your instance of the DataBase might not be the same as other people’s DataBase so your Model will then be different, so then things that work on your computer might now work on their computer… so you will be sad.  Don’t be sad.</li>
  <li>After running <code>$ rake db:migrate</code>, you will get feed back from the DataBase if anything was created or destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so that’s enough about migrations.  Let us run our migration already and see what happens.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ rake db:migrate
== 20150414105652 CreateProducts: migrating ===================================
-- create_table(:products)
   -&gt; 0.0026s
== 20150414105652 CreateProducts: migrated (0.0027s) ==========================
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Great!</strong> We have a Products table and our migration file worked.  Let’s instantiate an object with a name of “soap”.  We can go into the console through the command <code>$ rails console</code> from the Terminal.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The ActiveRecord gives us many methods to interface with the DataBase.  <code>.create(...)</code> is a mass assignment method that allows us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>instantiate a new table row object</li>
  <li>assign more attributes at once</li>
  <li>save the information to the DataBase</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with mass assignment <code>.create()</code> we could run several methods if we wanted to, even though they do the same thing.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>item = Product.new</code></li>
  <li><code>item.name = "soap"</code></li>
  <li><code>item.save</code></li>
</ul>

<p>After, saving information to the Data base, the <code>.find</code> method could retrieve information.</p>

<p>One convention is <code>CLASS.find_by_ATTRIBUTE VALUE</code> so for our Model:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>// from rails console
<span class="gp">&gt; </span>Product.find_by_name <span class="s2">"soap"</span>
Product Load <span class="o">(</span>0.2ms<span class="o">)</span>  SELECT  <span class="s2">"products"</span>.<span class="k">*</span> FROM <span class="s2">"products"</span>  WHERE <span class="s2">"products"</span>.<span class="s2">"name"</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'soap'</span> LIMIT 1
 <span class="o">=</span>&gt; <span class="c">#&lt;Product id: 1, name: "soap", created_at: "2015-04-14 11:13:54", updated_at: "2015-04-14 11:13:54"&gt; </span>
</code></pre>

<p>So, that’s how the Model layer can save items or even retrieve data from the DataBase.</p>

<p>Let’s just link up our products#index Action with the DataBase!</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/app/contollers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @product = Product.find_by_name "soap"
  end
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>In our <code>Index</code> view we now have a Products object and not just a soap string…  I’ll display the <code>:name</code> AND <code>:created_at</code> just to show we can do more with an object.  Change the view file accordingly.</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// coolness/app/views/products/index.html.erb
&lt;%= render "partials/nav" %&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;You've a dirty guy so have some: &lt;%= @product.name %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This was made at: &lt;%= @product.created_at %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And now seeing our new view with the Products object instead of the string…</p>

<p><img alt="View of Index render with object from DataBase" src="../../../../images/index_view.png" /></p>

<h6 id="figure-z-view-of-index-render-with-object-from-database">Figure Z: View of Index render with object from DataBase</h6>

<p>So, we’ve done a lot…  Thinking about the Visual Pneumonic, we’ve taken a request from the User and moved to the <code>routes.rb</code> file.  Then, on to ActionController <code>Index</code> method, and we accessed the Product table from the DataBase through ActiveRecord.  Finally, we assembled a view and Responded to the User by <code>rendering</code> the Index view.</p>

<p><strong>It is good.</strong></p>

<p>In TeaLeaf we also created Associations, but I’m sure you’re tired and we can call it a day.  Really quick though, Associations are a way of connecting one Model with other Models, so for example we had Products AND Users, we could have Users be associated to Products by a “has many” association.</p>

<p>The benefit to this would mean that we would have more methods to access information from either User table and Products table given one instance object/row.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, we’ve run through a Response and Request with a Rails Application Model.  The Pneumonic helped us focus on the files of most importances, and we were able to program various layers using Rails conventional methods.  Next week, we’ll move into Forms…</p>
